  summary: The PhD project is the estimation of the added wave and frictional resistances using in-situ measurement data. Therefore the two main research areas are ship seakeeping and statistical modelling (incl. machine learning and time series analysis). My research will focus on state of the art deep learning methods.

  summary: My MEng thesis was about the multiobjective hullform optimization of a fast battery-driven catamaran using different CFD tools including a novel software based on thin ship theory. This task enhanced my knowledge about potential flow and viscous CFD software and theory. Furthermore, I had the chance to participate in the two EU research projects TrAM and HOLISHIP.
